# JDM Import Cost Calculator

This project initially came about as a side development for a friends JDM car import business. The calculator works by taking the winning bid for a vehicle, in YEN, and running it through a preset formula to determine the approximate final cost to import said vehicle. 

As I get more free time to clean things up, I will put together a proper README file.
