# JDM Import Cost Calculator

This project initially came about as a side development for a friends JDM car import business. The calculator works by taking the winning bid for a vehicle, in YEN, and running it through a preset formula to determine the approximate final cost to import said vehicle. 

Please note that this script does make use of the currconv.com API.

The main, static costs, which generally tend to be the same regardless of a vehicle are defined across several variables inside the includes/config.inc.php file. This is also where the main $profit variable is set which is where you set the overall markup you want to add for your services. 

As I get more free time to clean things up, I will put together a proper README file.
